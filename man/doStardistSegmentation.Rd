\usage{
doStardistSegmentation(
  Image_dir,
  python_env = "giotto_segmentation",
  mask_output,
  model_name = "2D_versatile_fluo",
  nuclei_channel = NULL,
  prob_thresh = NULL,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Image_dir}{character, required. Provide a path to an image.}

\item{python_env}{python environment with Stardist installed.
default = "giotto_segmentation". See Stardist official website for more details.}

\item{mask_output}{required. Provide a path to the output mask file.}

\item{model_name}{Name of the model to run inference. Default to '2D_versatile_fluo'. 
If using HE model, input image must be RGB, else the nuclei_channel must be given}

\item{nuclei_channel}{Required using IF based nuclei segmentation, channel number of the nuclei staining.}

\item{prob_thresh}{prob_thresh for model (if not given use model default)}

\item{nms_thresh}{nms_thresh for model (if not given use model default)}
}
\value{
No return variable, as this will write directly to output path provided.
}
\description{
perform the Giotto Wrapper of Stardist 2D segmentation. This is for a model
inference to generate segmentation mask file from input image.
