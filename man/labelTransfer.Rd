\description{
When two sets of data share an embedding space, transfer the labels from
one of the sets to the other based on KNN similarity voting in that space.
}
\details{
This function trains a KNN classifier with \code{\link[FNN:knn]{FNN::knn()}}.
The training data is from object \code{y} or \code{source_cell_ids} subset in \code{x} and
uses existing annotations within the cell metadata.
Cells without annotation/labels from \code{x} or \code{target_cell_ids} subset in \code{x}
will receive predicted labels (and optional probabilities when
\code{prob = TRUE}).

\strong{IMPORTANT} This projection assumes that you're using the same dimension
reduction space (e.g. PCA) and number of dimensions (e.g. first 10 PCs) to
train the KNN classifier as you used to create the initial
annotations/labels in the source Giotto object.

This function can allow you to work with very big data as you can predict
cell labels on a smaller & subsetted Giotto object and then project the cell
labels to the remaining cells in the target Giotto object. It can also be
used to transfer labels from one set of annotated data to another dataset
based on expression similarity after joining and integrating.

\examples{
g <- GiottoData::loadGiottoMini("visium")
id_subset <- sample(spatIDs(g), 300)
n_pred <- nrow(pDataDT(g)) - 300

# transfer labels from one object to another ###################
g_small <- g[, id_subset]
# additional steps to get labels to transfer on smaller object...
g <- labelTransfer(g, g_small, labels = "leiden_clus")

# transfer labels between subsets of a single object ###########
g <- labelTransfer(g,
    label = "leiden_clus", source_cell_ids = id_subset, name = "knn_leiden2"
